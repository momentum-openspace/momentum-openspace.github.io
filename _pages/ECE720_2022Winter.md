## Course Description
---
*3 (fi 6) (either term, 3-0-0) Introductory and advanced topics in Machine Learning System Engineering (MLSE). Traditional software engineering, software quality assurance, and state-of-the-art software testing, analysis, etc. General-purpose machine learning and deep learning. Testing and analysis of deep learning. State-of-the-art quality assurance and engineering for machine learning-based software systems, and the future trends.

## Prerequisites
---
This course is mostly self-contained, basic previous knowledge of traditional software engineering, testing, analysis, machine learning and deep learning are helpful, but not mandatory.

## Course synchronous and asynchronous content delivery schedule
---
Lectures are delivered synchronously via zoom meeting. Lecture and hands-on materials are posted on eClass for asynchronous learning.

## Course Objectives & General Content
---
Descriptive statement of the overall course objectives and general content to be covered in the course. This
can include general information about course delivery, the importance of the course, how it fits into the
overall program, etc. The data-driven AI systems(e.g., machine/deep learning) continue to achieve
substantial strides in enabling cutting-edge intelligent applications, ranging from image recognition, virtual
assistant (e.g., Alex, Siri), art design, autonomous vehicles, to medical diagnosis tasks. However, the
development of current data-driven AI systems still lacks systematic quality assurance and engineering
support in regard to the adoption of quality, security and reliability assurance standards, as well as the
available mature toolchain support. The black-box nature of such AI systems poses challenges in the
interpretation and understanding of the behaviors of AI systems as observed in the many recent failures of
such systems. To enable safe, secure and reliable data-driven AI systems, a recent new interdisciplinary
field "Machine Learning System Engineering (MLSE)" is formed and fastly growing in the past few years, which reconsiders the whole development lifecycle, providing quality assurance and engineering support for
building trustworthy AI systems. The objectives of this course are to introduce the basics and current
state-of-the-art techniques along this exciting direction, which includes but is not limited to:

- To introduce basic concepts of software engineering and data-driven AI (e.g., machine learning, deep
learning)
- To understand the quality assurance and common techniques for "the traditional software" development
process
- To learn the basics of machine learning system engineering
- To learn the basics and advanced techniques on quality assurance and common techniques of machine
learning system engineering
- To understand ongoing research and industrial practices of machine learning system engineering, and the
potential value and impacts.


## Learning Outcomes:
---
By the end of this course, students should be able to:

1. Understand the basics of machine learning system engineering
2. Know the quality assurance of traditional software development process
3. Learn Automated testing of traditional software
4. Understand testing and analysis of machine learning enabled software
5. Get familiar with debugging and repairing of machine learning enabled software
6. Know the current research trend and some industrial practices of machine learning system engineering

The Faculty recommended grade point average for a 700 level course is 0.0. Instructors have the leeway to
deviate from this average and can assign grades based on their own scheme. All grades are approved by
the department chair (or delegate). The office of the Dean has final oversight on all grades.

### Term Work
All term work solutions will be posted no later than the last day of classes. All term work will be returned to
students by the final day of classes, with the exception of major term work due in the last week of classes.
The latter will be returned by the day of the final examination or the last day of the examination period if
there is no final examination in the course as per university policy; instructors will make accommodations to
return these term work. It is the responsibility of the student to pick up all their term work at the specified
time and place. Any unreturned term work, shall be retained and then shredded six months after the
deadline for reappraisal and grade appeals. Final examinations will be kept for one year as required by
university guidelines and the Government of Alberta's Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.
